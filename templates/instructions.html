                    Automatic Chord Transcriber by Neil Ã“ Briain.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This system will automatically transcribe chords from an uploaded
                    audio file. The recording should be of a single isolated instrument in order to work correctly.
                    Instructions below will explain how to use each aspect of the system to get the
                    best out of the available transcription options. Chord results can be modified and saved
                    as required.

                <details>
                    <summary>Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)</summary>
                    <p>Signal processing-based method.<br>
                    Chord types: Major, Minor, Suspended (2nd and 4th), Diminished, Augmented.<br>
                    Faster than CNN, more susceptible to noise.<br>
                    No instrument-specific preference.<br>
                    Evaluation: 88.45% accuracy against full audioPianoTriad dataset.</p>

                    <p>Deep learning-based AI model.<br>
                    Chord types: Major, Minor.<br>
                    Slower than FFT, less susceptible to noise.<br>
                    Trained on piano chord data.<br>
                    Evaluation: 99.45% accuracy on test set from audioPianoTriad dataset (Maj and Min chords).</p>

                <h5>Choosing auto / manual BPM:</h5>
                <p>
                Beats Per Minute (BPM) is used to split the track into chord blocks for transcription. If you know the
                BPM of the track, you should set this manually. Otherwise, select the automatic prediction box.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h4>Transcription Page Settings</h4>
                <p>
                    Once the file has been transcribed, you will be able to review and refine chord predictions before saving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use the audio player above the chord listing to play the file. Predicted chords are time-aligned and highlighted
                    as the song plays. Any chords can be edited by double clicking on
                    their chord box. The box colour will change to yellow and allow you to edit the chord name. Press
                    esc to cancel the edit, or press enter to confirm it.
                </p>
                <h5>Choosing a Save Format:</h5>
                <details>
                    <summary>Save as Plain Text (.txt)</summary>
                    <p>
                        Saves the chords as plain text which can be opened in programs like Notepad.<br><br>
                        Use this if you want a simple text file of chord names similar to the interface, which can
                        be easily viewed or printed as required.<br><br>
                        All information in the chord boxes is saved as-is.
                    </p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Save as MusicXML (.xml)</summary>
                    <p>
                        Saves the chords in MusicXML format which can be opened in programs like Musescore and Sibelius.<br><br>
                        Use this if you want to work in other music software with sheet music. The chord names are converted to their
                        relevant triads and placed on the treble clef with voice-leading automatically implemented.<br><br>
                        Only chords named using the correct format will be saved, so bare this in mind if editing chords in the interface before saving.
                        Otherwise an empty measure will be listed in the score for that bar.<br><br>
                        Naming format: Note name + chord type (no spaces)<br>
                        Valid note name format: C, D#, Gb etc.<br>
                        Valid chord type format: maj, min, sus2, sus4, dim, aug.<br>
                        Example valid chords: Cmaj, Ebaug, Bsus4, C#dim etc.
